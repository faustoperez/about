        <h1>Fausto P√©rez ‚Äì Senior Product Designer</h1>
        <p>I design web products, specializing in data visualization and GIS web map interfaces. I‚Äôm currently working at <a href="https://cervest.earth">Cervest</a>‚Äôs product team, where I help define and build its Climate Intelligence Platform.</p>
		<p>Previously, I was at <a href="https://vizzuality.com/">Vizzuality</a>, where I led the design of open source projects related to biodiversity and equality. Before that, I worked as a UX designer at <a href="https://www.designit.com/">Designit</a>.</p>
        <p>I am comfortable working with code. I have experience teaching HTML and CSS to a class of Master students at the Istituto Europeo di Design in Madrid.</p>
        <p>I live in Spain with my wife and my two kids.</p>
		<p>In another life, I used to <a href="http://faustone.com/">build guitar amplifiers</a> and <a href="https://play.spotify.com/artist/60DBQyJdsDMwQxr4cZ9twV">play in a band</a>.</p>

        <h2>From vision to market: defining the product at a hypergrowth startup üöÄ</h2>
        <p class="role">Role: Senior Product Designer</p>
        <p>At Cervest, we are building a category-leading platform to track and quantify climate risk at the asset level.</p>
        <p>I have contributed my expertise in interaction design, GIS, and data visualization projects that helped the team build in 3 months a clean and easy-to-use MVP that set the <a href="https://cervest.earth/earthscan"> EarthScan product foundations</a>.</p>
        <p>I‚Äôve also led the work on future-state product demos that have played a vital role in the conversations with investors, resulting in a <a href="https://cervest.earth/news/cervest-raises-30m-series-a-round-to-lead-new-40-billion-climate-intelligence-market">successful $30 million Series A funding round</a>.</p>
        <p>The details of this work are under an NDA.</p>

        <h2>Global Forest Watch: empowering people to better protect forests üå≥</h2>
        <p class="role">Role: Lead Designer</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.globalforestwatch.org/">Global Forest Watch</a> is the world‚Äìleading web‚Äìmapping application to track deforestation everywhere on Earth using satellite data. It is a combination of tools that empower people to protect forests better.</p>
        <p>I have a special affection for this project because this is where I honed my skills as a data visualization designer.</p>
        <p>I was involved in all phases of the design process, including remote user interviews, client communication and ideation workshops, and contributed solutions to critical sections of the web app, such as the interactive map, the country dashboards, and the blog.</p>

        <p>In my years in the project, we were continuously iterating on <a href="https://www.globalforestwatch.org/map/">the responsive map interface</a>, which is the flagship element of the application, by periodically engaging with the end-users to inform our design decisions and be able to support our choices with research and data.</p>

        <p>The <a href="https://www.globalforestwatch.org/dashboards/global/">country dashboards section</a> of Global Forest Watch features global and country stats and deforestation-related information. Below are some data visualization widgets I have helped create for the country dashboards in collaboration with the data science team: line charts, lollipop charts, histograms, bubble charts, Sankey diagrams, and flow maps.</p>

        <p>I also contributed to redesign the blog section, for both desktop and mobile, aiming for a pleasant multilingual reading experience. IWe paid special attention to accessibility issues, printing styles and readability in this redesign.</p>

        <h2>The Half-Earth map: conveying the idea of an evocative, beautiful planet worth protecting üåç</h2>
        <p class="role">Role: Lead designer, Design coordination</p>
        <p>Conceived by E.O. Wilson, Half-Earth is a call to conserve half the Earth‚Äôs land and sea to manage sufficient habitat to safeguard the bulk of biodiversity.</p>
        <p>In this project, we worked with the E.O. Wilson Biodiversity Foundation, Map of Life, and Esri to construct an interactive globe depicting the diversity of life on Earth and answer E.O. Wilson‚Äôs call to action to commit half of the planet‚Äôs surface to nature.</p>
        <p>As well as contributing to the design of <a href="https://map.half-earthproject.org/">the interactive platform</a>, I had the privilege of coordinating the work of two of my favorite designers, the talented <a href="https://stefaniacasal.com/">Estefan√≠a Casal</a> and Esri‚Äôs own <em>mapgician</em> <a href="https://www.esri.com/arcgis-blog/products/arcgis-pro/mapping/creating-the-half-earth-vibrant-basemap/">John Nelson</a>, who created the most fantastic experience of fun and collaborative cartography: the Half-Earth vibrant map.</p>
        <p>To celebrate the outcome of our work, the Half-Earth map was then added to Esri's catalog of basemaps to be enjoyed by happy designers and geographers in the future.</p>

        <h2>Designing an optimal experience for Olympic and Paralympic Games broadcasters ü§∏</h2>
        <p class="role">Role: Lead designer, Project coordination</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.obs.tv/home">Olympic Broadcasting Services</a> (OBS) is the host broadcast organization for the Olympic and Paralympic Games. TV networks worldwide rely on their information throughout the preparations and during each Olympic and Paralympic Games.</p>
        <img src="img/obs01.png" alt="Olympic Broadcasting Services logo">
        <p>In this project, we completely redesigned the broadcaster user experience to make it easier to view, search, edit, organize and re-use media files such as documents, venues and stadiums plans, technical manuals, photos, broadcast-quality videos, etc.</p>
        <p>I was also responsible for project managing tasks and communicating with the client.</p>
        <p>We conducted several internal OBS and broadcaster interviews to understand their needs and expectations better. We analyzed the content of their existing website and performed desk research to identify further opportunities. Then we held a workshop with the client to share the analysis and insights from the Research phase, co-create the variables and share the principles to guide the new design.</p>
        <img src="img/obs02.png" alt="Olympic Broadcasting Services workshop">
        <p>We then distilled the shared vision we had co-created with the client into simple, easy-to-understand concepts and reusable design patterns. We generated the main screens for all the different resolutions and the related documentation to help convey our design decisions to the client. We communicated the interaction details using low-fidelity prototypes.</p>
        <img src="img/obs03.png" alt="Olympic Broadcasting Services wireframes">
        <p>In the visual phase, we applied the Olympic brand and colors to all key screens for both desktop and mobile. We created the products‚Äôs design system, low and high fidelity prototypes and support guidelines and files for developers. We did this for both the private site (only accessed by TV professionals) and the public site, aimed at the general public.</p>

        <h2>A passion for music: building tube guitar amplifiers and pedals üé∏</h2>
        <p class="role">Role: Everything!</p>
        <p>During my music years, I started a guitar amplifier business. It felt good to build and deliver actual products you could touch, smell and play with. I learned a lot about product design, industrial design, running my own business, and dealing with providers, distributors, and end-users.</p>
        <p>When I no longer had the time to build these boxes, <a href="https://faustone.com/pdf/Faustone_Valve_Klipper_schematic.pdf">I open-sourced the schematics</a> for anyone to try their own.</p>
        <p>A while ago, I made a website about it you can still visit at <a href="https://faustone.com/">faustone.com</a>.</p>
